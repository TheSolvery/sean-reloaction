# The Relocationist - Static Website

This repository contains the source code for Sean's Relocation Services' simple static website. The website is built using GitHub Pages, Markdown, and CSS.

## Overview

The website consists of two main files:

1. `index.md`: This file contains the content of the landing page written in Markdown format.
2. `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS rules used to style the landing page.

GitHub Pages automatically converts the Markdown content in `index.md` into HTML and applies the styles from `styles.css` when serving the website.

## How to Edit the Website

To edit the content or styling of the website, simply update the respective `index.md` or `styles.css` file and commit the changes to the repository. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and update the website with your changes.

### Editing Content

Edit the `index.md` file to update the content of the website. The file uses Markdown syntax for formatting. You can learn more about Markdown syntax here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

### Editing Styles

Edit the `styles.css` file to update the styling of the website. The file uses standard CSS rules to apply styles to HTML elements generated from the Markdown content.

## Deployment

The website is hosted using GitHub Pages. Any changes committed and pushed to the repository will be automatically deployed to the live website.

If you have set up a custom domain for the website, the changes will be accessible at your custom domain. If not, the website will be accessible at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/your_repository_name/`. Replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username and `your_repository_name` with the name of this repository.
